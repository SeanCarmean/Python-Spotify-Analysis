# Python-Spotify-Analysis

Analyzing *Spotify* top 200 songs per week from 2017-2018 across 53 countries. The data set used was provided via [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking?select=data.csv)

This was my last case study in my **CareerFoundry** course and was an exploratory analysis. Some actions taken included:
1. Open sourcing the data
2. Combining data with a .shp file for a more in-depth geographic analysis
3. Performing regression analysis and applying machine learning
4. Creating a [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sean.carmean/viz/SpotifyDataAnalysis_16286423540320/Story1) storyboard with all analysis.
